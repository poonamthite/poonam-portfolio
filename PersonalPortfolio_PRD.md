# Personal Portfolio ‚Äì PRD

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a modern, responsive personal portfolio website for **Poonam Bomble**, a Senior Software Engineer with over 9 years of experience in frontend development.

- Create a responsive personal website that reflects Poonam‚Äôs frontend development expertise.
- Showcase resume content in a structured, interactive, and visually appealing format.
- Link to external profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub).
